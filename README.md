## Introduction
LeetCode is a platform that provides a collection of coding challenges to help software engineers prepare for technical interviews. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, and databases. This repository aims to help you find Java solutions for these problems to better understand the concepts.

 ## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Each problem has its own folder, named after the LeetCode problem number (e.g., twosum).
Inside each folder, you'll find a Java file containing the solution (Solution.java).
