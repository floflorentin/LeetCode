## Introduction
LeetCode is a platform that provides a collection of coding challenges to help software engineers prepare for technical interviews. The problems cover a wide range of topics, including data structures, algorithms, and databases. This repository aims to help you find Java solutions for these problems to better understand the concepts and improve your problem-solving skills.

 ## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Each problem has its own folder, named after the LeetCode problem number (e.g., twosum).
Inside each folder, you'll find a Java file containing the solution (Solution.java).
